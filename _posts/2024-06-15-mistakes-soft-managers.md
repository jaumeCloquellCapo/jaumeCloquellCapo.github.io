## Delegate, don’t be a bottleneck

Leads must prioritize transparent communication with their teams, sharing crucial business information such as goals, context, next steps, roadmaps, and partnerships. Concealing information only hampers the team's ability to perform optimally, especially in the realm of software engineering where access to project data is essential for delivering high-quality work.

Simply analyzing problems and passing them on for implementation can undermine the team's confidence in their own abilities. No one enjoys feeling like a mere executor without the opportunity to question or contribute to decisions.

Micromanaging every detail might appear efficient, but it often leads to bottlenecks rather than improving processes. Instead, leads should empower their teams by fostering transparency and trust. This approach not only enhances efficiency but also allows team members to develop their skills and take ownership of their work.

It's crucial for leads to adjust their management style based on the team's level of competence and experience, avoiding excessive control and nurturing a collaborative environment where everyone's input is valued.

## Abuse time Meetings

A common pitfall for busy leads is scheduling meetings at their convenience without considering their team's productivity hours. Demanding detailed explanations from developers can severely impact their workflow.

Teams suffer when meetings disrupt their focus, so it's crucial to minimize unnecessary meetings and schedule essential ones at optimal times—early morning, before or after lunch, or late afternoon—without interrupting their productive periods.

Inconsiderate scheduling can significantly affect team morale and output. Booking meetings during peak concentration times like mid-morning or mid-afternoon can derail productivity for the entire day.

## Be part of the team

Leads who only speak in general terms, buzzwords to impress and mumbo jumbo are alien to the team quotidian. 

Effective leadership involves being actively involved in the team's activities, occasionally getting hands-on or reducing managerial distance. A manager should understand and support the team closely to foster a collaborative and supportive environment.

This approach not only enhances manager-team rapport but also facilitates real-time project updates.
