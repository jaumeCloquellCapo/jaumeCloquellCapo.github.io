## Managing the wrong amount 

Managers must communicate with the team about the business, goals, context, next steps, roadmaps, partners, and more. Little or nothing should be hidden from the team. Soft. Enginyeers can only give their best when they have the project's data.

Comprehensively analyzing a problem and then handing it over to the team for implementation shows a lack of confidence in their skills. No one likes being a mere performer with no say in the matter or being unable to question things.

Lack of transparency hinders team efficiency. While it might seem efficient to micromanage every detail, it often creates bottlenecks rather than streamlining processes.

Managers must learn to relinquish control and trust their teams. Micromanaging every aspect isn't feasible or productive instead, manage projects according to the owner’s level of task-relevant maturity.

## Abuse time Meetings

A common pitfall for busy managers is scheduling meetings at their convenience without considering their team's productivity hours. Demanding detailed explanations from developers can severely impact their workflow.

Teams suffer when meetings disrupt their focus, so it's crucial to minimize unnecessary meetings and schedule essential ones at optimal times—early morning, before or after lunch, or late afternoon—without interrupting their productive periods.

Inconsiderate scheduling can significantly affect team morale and output. Booking meetings during peak concentration times like mid-morning or mid-afternoon can derail productivity for the entire day.

## Not be part of the team

Managers who only speak in general terms, buzzwords to impress and mumbo jumbo are alien to the team quotidian. 

Effective leadership involves being actively involved in the team's activities, occasionally getting hands-on or reducing managerial distance. A manager should understand and support the team closely to foster a collaborative and supportive environment.

This approach not only enhances manager-team rapport but also facilitates real-time project updates.
